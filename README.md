# Machine Learning on Modulation Format Recognition (MFR)

Evaluation and analysis of Modulation Format Recognition described in the paper:
> [Machine Learning Based Optimal Modulation Format Prediction for Physical Layer Network Planning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8473593)

Also, we provide an implementation of the optical transmission channel using the Gaussian noise (GN) approach described in the paper:
>  [Recent advances in the modeling of the impact of nonlinear fiber propagation effects on uncompensated coherent transmission systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7577767/)
